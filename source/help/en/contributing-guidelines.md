## How to ask a question

* [Create a new discussion for each question](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow/discussions).
* Describe your question and which problems you have.
* Add a lot of details, the more we know the better we can help.
* Select an answer, when your question has been answered.

## How to report a bug

* [Create a new discussion for each bug](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow/discussions).
* Explain what doesn't work and how to reproduce the error.
* Add a lot of details, the more we know the better we can help.
* Check the file `system/extensions/yellow.log` for error messages.

## How to create an extension

* [Start with an example feature](https://github.com/schulle4u/yellow-extension-helloworld), [example theme](https://github.com/schulle4u/yellow-extension-basic) or [translation](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-extensions/tree/master/source/english).
* Imagine what the user wants to do, aim for a simple solution.
* Upload your extension to GitHub, let us know if you need help.
* Publish your extension in the official repository.

## Tips for active contributors

We think people should be in the centre. Understanding people's needs and problems is a part of product development. Our job is not to bring more technology and more features into people's lives. Our first task is to remove complexity and problems from people's lives. Our second task is to find like-minded people and work together.
 
Our community is a place to help each other. Where you can ask and answer questions. Most answers are provided by community members, just like you. Consider that other people may not have the same experience level or background as you. Never feel compelled to react or respond to anyone. You can step out of conversations at any time, if the discussion isn't constructive.

Our goal is to answer questions and bugs within 30 days, but low-quality contributions will be removed to not overwhelm our community. We believe that asking questions is a privilege, not a right. Let us know how we can create a pleasant work environment. [Feedback is very welcome](/contact/).
